# Website
This will be the repository where I learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website. I plan on having it hosted through Firebase, and will not be using ChatGPT to generate any code that will be pushed to this.

## Plans
While making this website, I plan on having a home page, a page about me, links to other accounts of mine, as well as animations and videos to make it look nicer. I also will try to have a log of what I do each session, and what resources I used to learn.
